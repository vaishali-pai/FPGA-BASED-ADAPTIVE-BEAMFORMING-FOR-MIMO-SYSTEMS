# FPGA-BASED-ADAPTIVE-BEAMFORMING-FOR-MIMO-SYSTEMS
Used the MVDR (Minimum Variance Distortionless Response) algorithm for interference suppression.
Implemented QR Decomposition (QRD) and Inverse QR Decomposition (IQRD) using systolic arrays.
Designed the architecture using VHDL for FPGA deployment.
Integrated CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer) for efficient Givens rotations.
Used fixed-point arithmetic to avoid multipliers and square roots in hardware.
Achieved real-time weight computation with low latency on FPGA.
Validated performance under dynamic RF conditions using embedded digital signal processin
